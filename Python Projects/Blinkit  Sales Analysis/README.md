## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Performed the following steps in Python using Jupyter/Colab:

* Loaded raw `.csv` file using Google Colab's file uploader
* Checked column datatypes and standardized categorical labels:

  * Normalized `Item Fat Content` by replacing `"LF"` and `"low fat"` with `"Low Fat"`, `"reg"` with `"Regular"`
* Ensured data consistency and removed irregular entries
* Verified data types and converted where necessary

## 📈 Visual Analysis Performed

Below are the business questions answered using visualizations:

1. **Total Sales by Fat Content**
   → Pie chart showing which fat content variant sells more
2. **Total Sales by Item Type**
   → Bar chart highlighting most profitable product categories
3. **Fat Content Distribution by Outlet Tier**
   → Stacked bar chart comparing Regular vs Low Fat sales across outlet locations
4. **Sales by Outlet Establishment Year**
   → Line chart indicating revenue trends over outlet age
5. **Sales by Outlet Size**
   → Pie chart to assess revenue contribution from outlet sizes
6. **Sales by Outlet Location Type**
   → Horizontal bar chart to find top-performing outlet tiers (urban, suburban, etc.)

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Regular items and Low Fat variants contribute distinctly across locations.
* Specific item categories dominate revenue (details in bar charts).
* Newer outlets tend to perform better—possibly due to better strategy or location.
* Outlet size and tier influence overall performance significantly.
