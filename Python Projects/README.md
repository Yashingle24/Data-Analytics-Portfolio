# 🐍 Python Projects – Data Analysis & Exploration

Welcome to the **Python Projects** folder — a space where I apply **Python** to explore, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets.

These projects demonstrate my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis using Python and popular libraries such as:

- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and wrangling  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for visualization and storytelling  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – for interactive analysis  

Whether it's cleaning messy data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), or uncovering patterns and insights, each project in this folder reflects my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
