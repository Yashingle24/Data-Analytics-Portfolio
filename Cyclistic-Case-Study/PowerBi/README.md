# 📂 Power BI Folder
This folder contains Power BI assets, including visualizations and transformation scripts.

## 📜 **Files**
- **screenshots/** → High-quality PNG/JPG snapshots of key dashboard visuals.
- **dashboard_recording.mp4** → A short video walkthrough of the dashboard’s interactive features.
- **PowerQuery_M.txt** → Power Query script for *data transformations* (trip duration, start hour, etc.).

## ❗ **Note on Dashboard File**
The original **Power BI (.pbix) file** exceeded upload limits, so instead of the full file, **screenshots and a video recording** have been provided. These resources showcase all key insights and report functionalities.

## 📊 **Dashboard Insights**
- **Member vs. Casual Riders** → Usage comparison.
- **Ride Duration & Frequency** → Breakdown of average trip times.
- **Seasonal Trends** → Peak months & off-season behavior.

## 🛠 **How to Use**
1. View the **screenshots/** folder for a static overview.
2. Watch **dashboard_recording.mp4** to see interactions.
3. Use **PowerQuery_M.txt** as a reference for data transformations.
