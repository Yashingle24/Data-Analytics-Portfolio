## 📊 *Project Overview*
- *Objective:* Analyze Cyclistic's ride data to boost membership conversion.
- *Context:* This project was assigned as part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** capstone case study. The goal is to uncover insights that can help **convert casual riders into annual members**.

## 🚲 *Company Scenario*
Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in **Chicago, USA**, launched in **2016** with the goal of providing a **convenient and inclusive transportation** option to both locals and visitors.

Over time, Cyclistic has identified **two types of customers**:  
- **Casual Riders:** Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes.  
- **Cyclistic Members:** Customers who purchase annual memberships.

According to Cyclistic's **finance analysts**, **annual members are significantly more profitable** than casual riders. While pricing flexibility helps attract a broader user base, **marketing director Lily Moreno** believes that increasing the number of annual members is **key to long-term growth**.

Rather than focusing on acquiring new customers, she wants to **target existing casual riders**—those already familiar with the service—to encourage them to convert to annual memberships.
